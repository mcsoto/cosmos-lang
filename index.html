<p>Cosmos is an in-development logic-functional, statically typed prototypal language.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="hljs-built_in">rel</span> main()
    x = io.<span class="hljs-built_in">read</span>()
    io.writeln(<span class="hljs-string">"hello, "</span>+x+<span class="hljs-string">'!'</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>The above might look like imperative code. In fact, it&#39;s made to resemble a modern scripting language- or perhaps even allow for an imperative-style of code.</p>
<p>However, it&#39;s a fully functional (or actually, <em>logic</em>) programming language.</p>
<p>The first hint of this is the usage of <code>rel</code> in the above example (standing for relation) rather than, say, <code>fun</code> (function).</p>
<p>In fact, we borrow from many schools-of-thought. Cosmos has a...</p>
<ul>
<li>Fully procedural, whitespace-sensitive syntax...</li>
<li>Functional features... (immutability, closures, type inference)</li>
<li>All while being a logic programming language... (relations, non-determinism)</li>
<li>...with objects!</li>
</ul>
<p>Cosmos is still in-development. Documentation is provided for development.</p>

<p>See at the <a href="https://mcsoto.github.io/cosmos-lang/quickstart.html">Quickstart</a> or the full <a href="https://mcsoto.github.io/cosmos-lang/guide.html">Guide</a>*.</p>
<p>The guide is meant to be more comprehensive and eventually provide a full documentation of the language. It may still need some proof-reading. The Quickstart is a quicker intro that assumes you have prior experience with procedural or functional languages.</p>
