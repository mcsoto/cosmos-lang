<p>Cosmos is an in-development logic-functional, statically typed prototypal language.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="hljs-built_in">rel</span> main()
    x = io.<span class="hljs-built_in">read</span>()
    io.writeln(<span class="hljs-string">"hello, "</span>+x+<span class="hljs-string">'!'</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>The above might look like imperative code. In fact, it&#39;s made to resemble a modern scripting language- or perhaps even allow for an imperative-style of code.</p>
<p>However, it&#39;s a fully functional (or actually, <em>logic</em>) programming language.</p>
<p>The first hint of this is the usage of <code>rel</code> in the above example (standing for relation) rather than, say, <code>fun</code> (function).</p>
<p>In fact, we borrow from many schools-of-thought. Cosmos has a...</p>
<ul>
<li>Fully procedural, whitespace-sensitive syntax...</li>
<li>Functional features... (immutability, closures, type inference)</li>
<li>All while being a logic programming language... (relations, non-determinism)</li>
<li>...<del>with objects</del>! (not included yet)</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#39;s a lot more to say but that will depend on which school-of-thought you belong to-- <em>how can logic language have objects? Why a procedural syntax? Why functional?</em> Truly, the Cosmos is vast.</p>
<p>Cosmos is in-development. Documentation is provided for development. Please understand that the language is in-development.</p>

<h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>
<h2 id="as-an-executable">As an Executable</h2>
<p>Cosmos can be installed by, (1). Installing Swi-Prolog (preferably 8.4+), (2) downloading the latest release, and (3) simply typing,</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-attribute">make</span>
</code></pre><p>in the project directory.</p>
<p>This should work on any system that can run Swi-Prolog.</p>
<p>You can test that the installation has succeeded.</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>cosmos -v
<span class="hljs-string">"Cosmos 0.13 beta - (Pl)"</span>
</code></pre><h2 id="pack">Pack</h2>
<p>Cosmos can be installed as a Swi-Prolog pack. This is recommended if you are already a Prolog user or plan to use the languages together.</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-selector-pseudo">:-</span> <span class="hljs-selector-tag">pack_install</span>(cosmos).
</code></pre><p>You can then load the language.</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-selector-pseudo">:-</span> <span class="hljs-selector-tag">use_module</span>(library(cosmos)).
<span class="hljs-selector-pseudo">:-</span> <span class="hljs-selector-tag">cquery</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'x=2'</span>).
</code></pre><p>As said, this is recommended if you&#39;re already a Prolog user since it means using the Cosmos facilities <em>inside</em> Prolog. This is somewhat redundant.</p>
<p>Naturally, you may install it both normally and as a pack.</p>
