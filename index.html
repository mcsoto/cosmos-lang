<p>Cosmos is an in-development logic-functional, statically typed prototypal language.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="hljs-built_in">rel</span> main()
    x = io.<span class="hljs-built_in">read</span>()
    io.writeln(<span class="hljs-string">"hello, "</span>+x+<span class="hljs-string">'!'</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>The above might look like imperative code. In fact, it&#39;s made to resemble a modern scripting language- or perhaps even allow for an imperative-style of code.</p>
<p>However, it&#39;s a fully functional (or actually, <em>logic</em>) programming language.</p>
<p>The first hint of this is the usage of <code>rel</code> in the above example (standing for relation) rather than, say, <code>fun</code> (function).</p>
<p>In fact, we borrow from many schools-of-thought. Cosmos has a...</p>
<ul>
<li>Fully procedural, whitespace-sensitive syntax...</li>
<li>Functional features... (immutability, closures, type inference)</li>
<li>All while being a logic programming language... (relations, non-determinism)</li>
<li>...with objects!</li>
</ul>

<p>The guide is meant to be a more comprehensive guide and documentation. It may perhaps need some proof-reading. The Quickstart is a quicker intro and assumes you have prior experience with procedural or functional languages.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Cosmos is a simple language that combines procedural, functional, logic programming and more.</p>
<h2 id="it-s-simple">It&#39;s simple</h2>
<p>It&#39;s a simple, minimal and user-friendly language.</p>
<p>Since it&#39;s a somewhat minimal language, it can be learned in a quick time-- as soon as you get used to programming in a LP paradigm.</p>
<p>Once you learn the basics, it&#39;s easy to use.</p>
<h2 id="it-s-safe">It&#39;s safe</h2>
<p>The language is checked for type, mode and runtime errors.</p>
